          <p>
            The Glamour Smackdown is the perfect place for dancers to
            truly shine &mdash; it is in a beautiful ballroom with special
            lighting, and we are bringing a full regulation-sized ballroom
            floor so dancers can show their best dancing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Glamour Smackdown will be especially extravagant because
            judges, spectators, coaches, and competitors are all invited
            to dress to impress.
